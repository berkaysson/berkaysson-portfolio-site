      <h3>Hey there, I'm Berkay Sonel</h3>
      <h1>
        Self-taught front-end developer with a passion for coding and creating
        web experiences

      <h3>What is my story ?</h3>
      <p>
        From a young age, I've always been drawn to problem-solving and bringing
        ideas to life, which is why I initially pursued a career in Civil
        Engineering. However, I soon realized that coding was my true ambition
        and made the decision to switch paths. One significant moment that
        solidified my passion for coding and made me realize I couldn't find the
        same joy in Civil Engineering was when I was 14 and started modding the
        game Mount and Blade using Python. It was an eye-opening experience that
        allowed me to explore the power of coding, customize the game to my
        liking, create things, and witness the endless possibilities of digital
        creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, my coding journey has been filled with excitement and
        continuous learning. The Odin Project, an invaluable resource, has
        played a pivotal role in shaping my expertise in modern web development
        practices. Through resources like The Odin Project, I've sharpened my
        skills in modern web development practices. I have learned and developed
        my skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React.js, and various other
        technologies. With these skills, I have the ability to create web
        applications and develop user interfaces. I continuously expand my skill
        set and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends
